{\bfseries{Ti\+Photo\+Locator}} is a free and Ad-\/free application that allows you to geotag your favorites photos, and add other contextual tags.\doxysection{Presentation}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
When you have a GPX file, that you recorded during your trip, you can sync your photos with the GPX file. But, if you don\textquotesingle{}t have recorded any GPX file, or if your photos are older than handheld GPS devices, the {\bfseries{Ti\+Photo\+Locator}} application will help you to geotag easily your photos on a map, and add some description tags.\doxysection{Exif and IPTC tags}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
{\bfseries{EXIF}} and {\bfseries{IPTC}} metadata are two different types of metadata, used in digital photography.

{\bfseries{EXIF}} metadata are usually generated automatically by the digital camera and contain technical information about the shot.

{\bfseries{IPTV}} metadata are filled manually by humans and contain editorial information such as the {\itshape title}, the {\itshape description}, {\itshape copy rights}, etc.

Details concerning the tags used by the application are on \doxysectref{this page}{p.}{md__d_1_2_mes_01_programmes_2_windows_2ti_photo_locator_2docs_2about__tags}{0}\doxysection{Technical information}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
The application is developped with the {\texttt{ Qt framework}} and uses the {\texttt{ Exif\+Tool utility}} by Phil Harvey to read and write the Exif and IPTC tags.
