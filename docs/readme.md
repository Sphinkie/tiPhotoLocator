# TI PHOTO LOCATOR

work in progress

## Pr√©sentation

When you have a GPX file, that you recorded during your trip, you can sync your photos with the GPX file.
But, if you don't have recorded any GPX file, or if your photos are older than handheld GPS devices, the **TiPhotoLocator** application will help you to geotag easily your photos on a map, and add some description tags.

## Tags

**TiPhotoLocator** manages the following EXIF and IPTC tags.
